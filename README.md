ASSIGNMENT WEEK 1.

I interacted with the HelloWorld contract .
I deployed it in the sepolia testnet.
The address of my contract deployment is :
0x4da8391cC0Af0880eaf6600A116E98808Ffe618c

* The contract has a constructor , that will be executed once the contract is being deployed . 
* It sets the msg.sender to the owner and the string "Hello World" as the string - text.
* The contract has three functions and a modifier
* The modifier onlyOwner means that The functions that has onlyOwner modifier to them means that Only the owner can call that function.
* So , setText and transferOwnership functions can only be called  by the owner.
* The helloWorld function function can be called by anyone and it returns the string- text.
* I set the string to various strings and also changed the owner .
* No issues with the contract and all the functions are working fine .
* I have verified my contract on sepolia. You can view it on sepolia etherscan here :
